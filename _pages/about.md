I created this extension in response to a growing number of comments from people who felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content about Elon Musk dominating their web experience. Whether it’s references to the Trump campaign, Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Starlink, or other ventures, it became a bit much for some.

This extension is designed to help alleviate that and give you back control over your browsing experience. Whether you want to completely block Elon-related content or just tone it down, this tool lets you enjoy your favourite websites without feeling overwhelmed.

It’s completely free, and I’mnot a professional developer, so it’s not perfect. But if you have any ideas or suggestions for improvement, please get in touch!
